Website
=======

Currently, the code over at GaProgMan.com is pretty bland. It's made up of four canvases, each is a link to a website. There's also a not to well hidden easter egg, but that's not going to be descibed here.

### Objective

Redesign the website, using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap and AngulaJs to make a responsive site that is more interactive.

GitHub information, for example, will be pulled with AnglularJs and displayed in an HTML5 canvas. There will be a Bootstrap NavBar at the top of the page for navigating around the website, and an RSS feed displaying agregated changes to the website, attached blogs, and GitHub.
